# directed-graphs-and-algorithms


This repository aims at creating a directed graph in C++ offering a reasonably effective suite of operations:
1. Computing spanning trees
2. Depth first traversals
3. Breadth first traversals
4. Implementing iterators.

It can also perform the following algorithms on the directed graph:
1. Shortest paths.
2. DAG testing.
3. DAG Hamiltonian path testing.
4. Connected component search.
5. Strongly connected component search.
6. Topological Sort.
